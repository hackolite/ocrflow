):
    """ Changes the brightness of an image by adding/subtracting a delta value to/from each pixel.
    The image format is assumed to be BGR to match Opencv's standard.

    Args:
        - image: numpy array representing the input image.
        - bboxes: numpy array representing the bounding boxes.
        - classes: the list of classes associating with each bounding boxes.
        - min_delta: minimum delta value.
        - max_delta: maximum delta value.
        - p: The probability with which the brightness is changed

    Returns:
        - image: The modified image
        - bboxes: The unmodified bounding boxes
        - classes: The unmodified bounding boxes

    Raises:
        - min_delta is less than -255.0
        - max_delta is larger than 255.0
        - p is smaller than zero
        - p is larger than 1
